## About
Small & simple OpenGL programming base/engine with fast as fxxk compilation, 
some of the code was took from my other projects like my 
[c_std_lib](https://github.com/DevHedronYT/c_std_lib)

## Build
- Install ``ninja`` build system
- Edit ``config.ninja`` to your needs
- Open terminal or cmd, and type ``ninja``

## Features

### Implemented

- Simple API
- Fast Compilation 
- Shaders & Uniforms
- Textures
- Inputs
- File I/O 
- Maths (Like GLM)
- Profiler
- Strings
- Colored Logging
- 2D

### Not Implemented

- Unit Testing
- Batch Rendering 
- 3D
- Textures
- UI, like Nuklear
- Physics Engine inspired by Godot and others online
- ECS
- Json Parser
- Documentation 
- APIs
- Web Compilation 
- Spatial Hashing / Chunking System
- Animation System
- Resource Manager
- Particle System
- Upscaling
- Text/Fonts
- Binary Asset Loader
- Video Settings
- Add more of the necessary headers from [c_std_lib](https://github.com/DevHedronYT/c_std_lib)
- Delta Time 
- Game State Functions
- Input Abstraction like Godot
- Level Editor
- Uninit Function
- Layering using stacks and queues
- Serialization
- Multi-threading 
- Maybe built-in sound and pixel art maker
- Maybe Requests implementation in C for online interaction
- Texture atlasing
- Broad Phase Collision Detection
- Spritesheed loader
- Masks and outlines
- Post processing (ambient occlusion, anti-aliasing, anti-exposure, bloom, rgba channel
mix, chromatic abberation, color adjustments, color curves, fog, depth of field, grain,
lens distortion, motion blur, lift, gamm, gain, panini projection, vignette, lighting) 

## Credits
Build system and files were written by [MousieDev](https://github.com/MousieDev), 
I just reiterated on them a bit. [NrdyBhu1](https://github.com/NrdyBhu1) as well
who helped a lot in development. Used 
[Resources.md](https://gist.github.com/DevHedronYT/0ffbebe2b2a8d64a3f057125fe1e3cb7#file-resources-md) 
as well
